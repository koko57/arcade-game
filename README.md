## About the Game

This is a frogger-style classic arcade game where you have to avoid the enemies and cross the board to win. When you succeed - you will be given 10 pts and the level goes up and the difficulty of the game increases every 3 levels. If you collide with the bug - you lose life. Remember! You have only 3 lives. You can gain additional points by collecting gems that appear on the board. 
You win when you reach 15th level or score 500 points. 
To move your avatar use the arrow keys.

Have fun and good luck!
